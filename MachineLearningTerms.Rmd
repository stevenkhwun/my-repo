# Types of Machine Learning

**Supervised machine learning**, which works with labeled data, and **unsupervised machine learning**, which works with unlabeled data.

Supervised machine learning falls into two categories - *classification* and *regression*. Classification algorithms predict the discrete classes (categories) to which samples belong. Regression models predict a continuous output.
